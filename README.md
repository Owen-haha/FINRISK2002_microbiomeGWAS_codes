The corresponding pre-print can be found at https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193045 (Combined effects of host genetics and diet on human gut microbiota and incident disease in a single population cohort).

This work is now under review in *Nature Genetics*.

We published the essential codes of the work here to help others to review or replicate our findings.

## Outline
There are 5 major analysis tasks in this project:

**1. Genotyping data analysis**

**2. Metagenomic sequencing data analysis**

**3. Genome-wide association test**

**4. Mendelian randomization analysis**

**5. Cox-regression**

The full summary results of GWAS have been submitted to GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). Access number: XXXX.
